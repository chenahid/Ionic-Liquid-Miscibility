# Ionic-Liquid-Miscibility
This folder contains two sets of ML weights and biases. The “ANN_weights_mix” directory stores the parameters for the regression model, while the “ANN_weights_binary” directory contains the parameters for the binary classification model. The associated Python code required to load and run these models is also included in this folder.
